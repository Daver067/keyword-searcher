What Is Drywall Mudding?

Drywall mudding consists of applying several coats of wet drywall compound to all the cracks and crevices of the wall. It is a pretty messy project, but it makes your walls look as neat as you want them to.

However, this mudding and taping must be done by specialists, as you need to have a particular skill level to make sure the cracks aren't noticeable anymore. Specialists are also able to determine, for example if fire taping drywall is recommended for your particular job.

Types of Drywall Mud

The two most common types of sheetrock mud are the following:

Premixed

Premixed compound is already mixed with water to be directly applied to the wall, but it can also be classified into several sub-types.

● All-purpose mud can be used in all projects, including taping drywall joints. The first step is to smooth it out on the wall and wait for it to dry.

● Topping mud is used to give a smooth finish to the final layer of the wall. It is then sanded and ready or paint.

● Lightweight all-purpose mud is like a combination of the previous two muds, as it can be used anywhere and gives you a beautifully smooth finish for painting on walls.

Powdered

Powered drywall mud is also called setting mud, and it is meant to be mixed with water to create the compound. This mud is supposed to dry faster and shrink less than premixed mud, and it is commonly used as a first layer to cover deeper gaps on the wall and for taping drywall ceilings. Moreover, you can find the following types of powdered mud.

● Timed drywall mud gives you a determined amount of time to work with before it dries, so you must be fast.

● Easy-to-sand setting mud prevents you from having to spend hours sanding and taping the drywall corners.
